# Premier League Legends React App
This is a web app mini wiki of the top 10 premier league legends (subjective) that displays information about them during their time in the premier league. This project uses an API that I created using Node and Express. Users will be able to see different info on each legend by clicking through the buttons. The app shows the user the legends name, their birth place, their goals, assists, and even a description of why they're a legend. 

# What I Learned
- Conditional Rendering 
- Setting state and updating that state based on value changes 
- Debugging in React 
- useEffect functionality along with the importance of the dependency array 
- Styling in React 
- Async/Await functions to fetch data
- Developing an API that handles requests
