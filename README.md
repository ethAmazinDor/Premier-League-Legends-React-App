# Premier League Legends React App
This is a web app mini wiki of the top 10 premier league legends (subjective) that displays information about them during their time in the premier league. Users will be able to see different info on each legend by clicking through the buttons. The app shows the user the legends name, their birth place, their goals, assists, and even a description of why they're a legend.
